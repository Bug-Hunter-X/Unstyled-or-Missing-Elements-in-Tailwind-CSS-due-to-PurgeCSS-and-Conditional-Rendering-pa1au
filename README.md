# Unstyled or Missing Elements in Tailwind CSS due to PurgeCSS and Conditional Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common but tricky bug in Tailwind CSS projects, specifically when using conditional rendering and Tailwind's PurgeCSS optimization. The problem arises when classes are defined but never actually applied due to a condition always being false or a component not being rendered. PurgeCSS removes these unused styles, leaving elements unstyled or missing.

## Bug Description
The issue manifests as unstyled or entirely missing elements in your application, without any explicit error messages in the browser's developer console. This makes it harder to track down than typical compilation errors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server.  (Instructions may vary slightly depending on your framework, refer to the `package.json` scripts.)
4. Observe that the button is missing, even though it's defined in the code.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all Tailwind classes are used at least once, even if it's through a dummy element or by changing the purge configuration.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible fix by adjusting the PurgeCSS configuration or using a workaround for conditional rendering.
