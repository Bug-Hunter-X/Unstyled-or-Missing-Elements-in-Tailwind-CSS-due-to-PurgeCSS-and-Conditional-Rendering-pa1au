This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue stems from Tailwind's purge functionality, which removes unused CSS classes to optimize bundle size. If your components' classes are not being used correctly in your templates, these classes will be removed from your final CSS output.  This leads to a situation where you have styles defined in your Tailwind configuration but they don't exist in your compiled CSS, resulting in elements not being styled correctly or not appearing at all.  Often, the browser's developer console will show no error messages, making it difficult to debug.  The actual symptom is unstyled or missing elements.  For example, a button with the class `bg-blue-500` might not appear blue, or a div with `p-4` might have no padding.

Example of problematic code (Next.js):

```jsx
// pages/index.js
function MyComponent() {
  const showButton = false; // This variable determines the button's visibility

  return (
    <div>
      {showButton && <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">Click Me</button>}
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

In this scenario, if `showButton` is always `false`, Tailwind's purge will remove `bg-blue-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, etc., because they're never actually used in the rendered output.
